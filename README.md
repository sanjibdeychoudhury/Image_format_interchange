# Image Type Converter

Image Type Converter is a Python-based interactive tool that detects an image's current format and allows you to convert it to a different format. The program prompts you to enter the input image path, displays the detected image type, asks for the desired output format, and then saves the converted image in the same folder as the input.

## Features

- **Interactive Input:** Prompts the user for the image file path.
- **Automatic Detection:** Detects and displays the current format of the image.
- **Flexible Conversion:** Allows conversion to common image formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, etc.).
- **Easy-to-Use:** Saves the converted image in the same folder as the input file.
